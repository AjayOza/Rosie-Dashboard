# Rosie-Dashboard

A test area for specific requirement. This repo is unlikely to be of help to you but feel free to have a look.

This is part of prospective ROSIE project - more detials on that project are not available as yet.

### Requirements

A section of website that is affectively a **dashboard** to show the performance of number of subjects according to a number of measures. The other areas of the website (e.g. menu) will be built elsewhere. There should be no sidebar and other features and the dashboard should take-up the full width of the screen. 

The user would select a subject of interest and the details of performance by each measure will be displayed in a table along with details of the subject (name, short description etc). Also displayed will be another table of performances of individuals within the group that the individual subject belongs to, defaulted to the first performance measure. The measure by which the group is measured can be changed by clicking a different measure on the first table. The details (units of measure, short description, url etc) of selected measure will also be desplayed.

R will be used to generate the performance analyses (averages per group, trends, year-to-date etc). 

These are short names used:

* `H` represents subjects of interest e.g. collection of Heroes (or hotels, hospitals or employees)
* `G` represents groups that an individual `H` is a member of e.g. a region or skill-set or area of activity
* `M` represents measures used to guage the performance of e.g. speed, agility (or complaints)

Elements to display:
